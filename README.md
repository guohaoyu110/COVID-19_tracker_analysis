# COVID-19_tracker\_analysis

## Topic: 
### Build a website doing the track and analysis of coronavirus in America, including frontend and backend development.
* Crawl data from the website maintained by [John Hopkins University CSSEGISandData/COVID-19: Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, provided by JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
* Update the virus data automatically every hour into the MySQL database, like how many people get infected, how many deaths, how many people get cured and so on.
* Build a search engine on the website. If people want to see the conditions of a specific city, just do the search and show the results.
* Build a prediction model to show how the coronavirus conditions evolve in the next ten days, using the SEIR or SIR model to modify.
* Encapsulate the functions we use in this project and upload it onto npm package for more people to use our API.
* Host this project on AWS or Google Cloud

### Frameworks considered to use: 
* Frontend framework: Angular
* Backend framework: Node.js
* Frontend icon: Google Map API
* Database: Firebase
